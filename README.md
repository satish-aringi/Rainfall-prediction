# Rainfall-prediction
Machine Learning project to predict rainfall using Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression. Implemented feature engineering, SMOTE for class balancing, and a 70-20-10 stratified split. Achieved 91% test accuracy using a soft voting ensemble model.
This project builds a supervised classification model to predict rainfall occurrence using multiple ML algorithms.


Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression

Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance

Engineered features such as:

Temperature difference

Lag-based rainfall indicators (1–3 days)

3-day rolling temperature averages

Used 70-20-10 stratified split for reliable evaluation

Achieved 91% test accuracy using a soft voting ensemble

 Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Imbalanced-learn
